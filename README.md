# Gun-Detection-Neural-Network
A neural network project for detecting guns, weapons and threats from live video feeds.

The focus of this project is to create a ConvNet (convolutional neural network) model for detecting guns and weapons in live video feeds. This is a dlib c++ project with a CNN model based on the dlib examples, but simplified into two programs, one for training the network and another for testing the network.
